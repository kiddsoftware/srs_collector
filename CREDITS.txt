The SVG clip icon was created by
http://openclipart.org/user-detail/perpaola and placed in the public
domain.  Our icon is a very loose derivative.

The small icons used throughout the GUI are part of Bootstrap 3, and are
provided by: http://glyphicons.com/

Many thanks to the artists who made this possible!
