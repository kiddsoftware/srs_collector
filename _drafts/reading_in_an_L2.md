You may find it very helpful to read longer books.  The first hundred pages
will be the hardest, but then you'll get used to the author's style.
Similarly, reading lots of books about the same subject will give you a
boost.

Reading in a foreign language will be slow going at first, but if you're an
English speaker learning a western European language, you should find it
much easier after your first 500 pages.  And after your first 3000 pages,
you should read fairly comfortably, at perhaps one quarter or one third of
the speed you read in your native language.
